Installation and Configuration
==============================

The preferred way
-----------------

On any system you can install depl directly from the Python package index
using pip::

    sudo pip install depl

If you want to install the current development version (master branch)::

    sudo pip install -e git://github.com/davidhalter/depl.git#egg=depl


Manual installation from a downloaded package
---------------------------------------------

If you prefer not to use an automated package installer, you can `download
<https://github.com/davidhalter/depl/archive/master.zip>`__ a current copy of
depl and install it manually.

To install it, navigate to the directory containing ``setup.py`` on your
console and type::

    sudo python setup.py install
