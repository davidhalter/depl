Why do we need another deploy tool?
-----------------------------------

Read `this article I wrote <>`_!

What depl does not
----------------

- No DNS configuration
- No central logging (yet?)

Support
-------

Current supports Ubuntu/Debian (apt-get), others:

- Arch Linux (pacman) could be implemented
- Fedora/CentOS/RHEL (rpm) could be implemented
- Windows/Apple: Discussions needed (but probably not?!).


Additional Ideas
----------------

- Add support for automatic travis conversions.
