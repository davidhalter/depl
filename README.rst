depl - deploy easy and fast.
============================

Please don't use this yet, it's in a planning phase. Pretty soon I'm going to
start a discussion about it. Everything here is incomplete. The only reason I'm
already deploying is that I'm trying to prepare myself for a major discussion
about Python web deployment and deployment in general.

Why do we need another deploy tool?

Read `this article I wrote <article>`_!

What depl does not
------------------

- No DNS configuration
- No central logging (yet?)

Support
-------

Current supports Ubuntu/Debian (apt-get), others:

- Arch Linux (pacman) could be implemented
- Fedora/CentOS/RHEL (rpm) could be implemented
- Windows/Apple: Discussions needed (but probably not?!).


Additional Ideas
----------------

- Add support for automatic travis conversions.
