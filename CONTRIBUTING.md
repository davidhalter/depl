Code Guidelines
---------------

- If you plan to add a feature to `depl`, please discuss its design first in an
  issue. I'm willing to add a lot of features, but they have to fit in with the
  rest!.
- For all generated files use a prefix ``depl_``, so that it's easy to find
  them.
- PEP8 for code styling: `flake8 --ignore=E501`
